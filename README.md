## CryptTalk
### Collaborate on code with developers around the world, no signups required.

CryptTalk is an **anonymous real-time developer discussion platform** where users can join topic-based rooms without signing up. Each room assigns a random coding problem to guide discussions, and includes a **live collaborative code editor** with controlled edit access. Users can request and grant edit permissions to prevent conflicts, while code changes sync in near real-time.

### Features
- Anonymous, topic-based queue matching and ephemeral rooms
- Random coding problem assigned per room to guide collaboration
